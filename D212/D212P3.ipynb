                "    <p>Determining common groupings of goods provided can assist the telecommunications business in creating bundles and discount groups, encouraging customers to purchase these goods from the business.If customers can purchase these bundles from our business, we can both improve customer satisfaction with the business, encouraging return customers, and ensure customers purchase our goods, rather than purhcasing these goods from competitors. I am specifically choosing to analyze the gas 2 pack because it is a lighter item that would be expected to be purchased alongside other, larger purchases.</p>\n",

                "    <p>Market Basket Analysis is a way to identify the most common groupings of products purchased. This is often used to create recommendations based on these groupings, allowing a business to create bundles or deals on the basis of these common groupings. The analysis is done by creating rules with an antecedent and consequent relationship. To put it in simple terms, we determine a value (the antecedent) and see if it has a causal relationship with the purchase of another item (the consequent).  To bring it back to the research question, I would anticipate that the result of this analysis will reveal a relationship that could be formulated as \"If a customer purchases the router, then they are likely to purchase X\" or \"customers that purchase X are more likely to purchase a router\"</p>\n",
