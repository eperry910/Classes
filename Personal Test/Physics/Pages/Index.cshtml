    <p style="color:white">This website is designed for educational purposes. When completed, the website will contain
        information for Physics, Linux, and Software Development, with more subjects potentially being added as time
        progresses. All of this is made by a single individual who is trying to learn more about all of the mentioned
        subjects, and wants to help others who are also learning, meaning that this website isn’t just my way of helping
        others out, it’s also my own notebook for each of these subjects.</p>
    <p style="color:white">Anyone that notices any issues, has any feedback, or desires a new subject to be added,
        please contact me at:
        eperry910@yahoo.com</p>
